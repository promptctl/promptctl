// [LAW:single-enforcer] One IPC site for the launch registry. Reads
// (`launch:list`, `launch:get`) and subscribe (`launch:subscribe` +
// push `launch:event` / `launch:list`) come from the registry's
// projection. Mutating channels — `launch:create` and `launch:terminate`
// — both flow through this module. Creation funnels into the spawn flow,
// the sole constructor of launch rows; termination kills the launch's
// tmux session and lets the correlator's existing pane-gone /
// window-close path call markExited.
//
// [LAW:one-source-of-truth] All payloads project off the registry — no
// caching at the IPC boundary. The handler is a thin pass-through.
